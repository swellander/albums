General Project Notes
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

- 1 component per file.

- only root component uses 'AppRegistry'

- Functional Components: component based on a function that returns JSX to be rendered on the device. Static, used to display basic content to user.

- Class Components: used for larger components. easier to organize. use helper methods. based on ES6 classes. Must define a render method that returns some amount of JSX. Do not require semi-colons
